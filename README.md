# AdaptiveFilter

Academic project related to filtering and electronics. The scope of the project is to create an Adaptive Filter using Least Mean Square method in Python. 
This is more of a digital representation of what this filter is capable of as it usually is created as an analog circuit. It should be able to de-noise digital, audio and photo signals.
